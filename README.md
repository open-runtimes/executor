Executor for [Open Runtimes](https://github.com/open-runtimes/open-runtimes), a runtime environments for serverless cloud computing for multiple coding languages.

Executor is responsible for providing HTTP API for building, creating and executing Open Runtimes. Executor is stateless and can be scaled horizontally when a load balancer is introduced in front of it. You could use any load balancer but we highly recommend using [Open Runtimes Proxy](https://github.com/open-runtimes/proxy) for it's ease of setup with Open Runtimes Executor.

## Features

* **Flexibility** - Configuring custom image lets you use **any** runtime for your functions.
* **Performance** - Coroutine-style HTTP servers allows asynchronous operations without blocking. We. Run. Fast! ‚ö°
* **Open Source** - Released under the MIT license, free to use and extend.

## Getting Started

1. Pull Open Runtimes Executor image:

```bash
docker pull openruntimes/executor
```

2. Create `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  openruntimes-executor:
    container_name: openruntimes-executor
    hostname: exc1
    stop_signal: SIGINT
    image: openruntimes/executor
    networks:
      runtimes:
    ports:
      - 9900:80
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - openruntimes-builds:/storage/builds:rw
      - openruntimes-functions:/storage/functions:rw
      - /tmp:/tmp:rw
      - ./functions:/storage/functions:rw
    environment:
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_ENV
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_RUNTIMES
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_CONNECTION_STORAGE
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_MAX_TIMEOUT
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_BUILD_TIMEOUT
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_CPUS
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_MEMORY
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_MEMORY_SWAP
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_INACTIVE_TRESHOLD
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_NETWORK
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_SECRET
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_LOGGING_PROVIDER
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_LOGGING_CONFIG
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD

networks:
  runtimes:

volumes:
  openruntimes-builds:
  openruntimes-functions:
```

> Notice we added bind to local `./functions` directory. That is only nessessary for this getting started, since we will be executing our custom function.

3. Create `.env` file:

```
OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_ENV=development
OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_RUNTIMES=php-8.0
OPEN_RUNTIMES_CONNECTION_STORAGE=file://localhost
OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_MAX_TIMEOUT=900
OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_BUILD_TIMEOUT=900
OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_CPUS=0
OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_MEMORY=0
OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_MEMORY_SWAP=0
OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_INACTIVE_TRESHOLD=60
OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_NETWORK=executor_runtimes
OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_SECRET=executor-secret-key
OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_LOGGING_PROVIDER=
OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_LOGGING_CONFIG=
OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME=
OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD=
```

> `OPEN_RUNTIMES_CONNECTION_STORAGE` takes a DSN string that represents a connection to your storage device. If you would like to use your local filesystem, you can use `file://localhost`. If using S3 or any other provider for storage, use a DSN of the following format `s3://access_key:access_secret@host:port/bucket_name?region=us-east-1`

> Docker compose names networks based on directory you are in. If your folder is not caled `executor`, you may need to change value of `OPEN_RUNTIMES_EXECUTOR_NETWORK` variable.

4. Start Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

5. Prepare a function we will ask executor to run:

```bash
mkdir -p functions && cd functions && mkdir -p php-function && cd php-function
printf "<?\nreturn function(\$req, \$res) {\n    \$res->json([ 'n' => \mt_rand() / \mt_getrandmax() ]);\n};" > index.php
tar -czf ../my-function.tar.gz .
cd .. && rm -r php-function
```

> This created `my-function.tar.gz` that includes `index.php` with a simple Open Runtimes script.

5. Send a HTTP request to executor server:

```bash
curl -H "authorization: Bearer executor-secret-key" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:9900/v1/runtimes/my-function/execution -d '{"image":"openruntimes/php:v2-8.0","source":"/storage/functions/my-function.tar.gz","entrypoint":"index.php"}'
```

6. Stop Docker containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```
