Executor for [Open Runtimes](https://github.com/open-runtimes/open-runtimes), a runtime environments for serverless cloud computing for multiple coding languages.

Executor is responsible for providing HTTP API for building, starting and executing Open Runtimes. Proxy is stateless and can be scaled horizontally when a load balanced is introduced in front of it. You could use any load balancer but we highly recommend using [Open Runtimes Proxy](https://github.com/open-runtimes/proxy) for it's ease of setup with Open Runtimes Executor.

## Features

* **Open Source** - Released under the MIT license, free to use and extend.

## Getting Started

1. Pull Open Runtimes Executor image:

```bash
docker pull openruntimes/executor
```

2. Create `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  openruntimes-proxy:
    image: openruntimes/proxy
    ports:
      - 9800:80
    environment:
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_ALGORITHM
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_EXECUTORS
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_HEALTHCHECK_INTERVAL
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_ENV
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_EXECUTOR_SECRET
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_SECRET
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_LOGGING_PROVIDER
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_LOGGING_CONFIG
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_HEALTHCHECK
  whoami1:
    hostname: whoami1
    image: containous/whoami
  whoami2:
    hostname: whoami2
    image: containous/whoami
```

> We are adding 1 proxy and 2 HTTP servers. Notice only proxy is exported, on a port `9800`.

3. Create `.env` file:

```
OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_ALGORITHM=round-robin
OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_EXECUTORS=whoami1,whoami2
OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_HEALTHCHECK=disabled
OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_SECRET=proxy-secret-key
OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_HEALTHCHECK_INTERVAL=5000
OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_ENV=development
OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_EXECUTOR_SECRET=executor-secret-key
OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_LOGGING_PROVIDER=
OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_LOGGING_CONFIG=
```

> Notice we disabled health check. We recommend keeping it `enabled` and implementing proper health check endpoint

4. Start Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

5. Send a HTTP request to proxy server:

```bash
curl -H "authorization: Bearer proxy-secret-key" -X GET http://localhost:9800/
```

Run the command multiple times to see request being proxied between both whoami servers. You can see `Hostname` changing the value.

> Noitce we provided authorization header as configured in `.env` in `OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_SECRET`.

6. Stop Docker containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

- Make example repo with proxy + 2 executors

Build:

```bash
curl -H "authorization: Bearer executor-secret-key" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:9900/v1/runtimes -d '{"remove":true,"runtimeId":"myruntimebuild","image":"openruntimes/php:v2-8.0","source":"/storage/functions/php.tar.gz","destination":"/storage/builds/myruntime","entrypoint":"index.php"}' | jq
```

Execute + Cold Start:

```bash
curl -H "authorization: Bearer executor-secret-key" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:9900/v1/execution -d '{"payload":"Developers are awesome!","variables":{"customVariable":"secretVariable"},"runtimeId":"myruntime","image":"openruntimes/php:v2-8.0","source":"/storage/functions/php.tar.gz","entrypoint":"index.php"}' | jq

```bash
curl -H "authorization: Bearer executor-secret-key" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:9900/v1/execution -d '{"payload":"Developers are awesome!","variables":{"customVariable":"secretVariable"},"runtimeId":"myruntime"}' | jq
